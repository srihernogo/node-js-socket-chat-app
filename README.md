Chatvia is built with bootstrap v5.3.3 in Nodejs, socket.io with responsive on all devices, and supported with Dark & Light modes.
It has many features like one-to-one chat – audio – video call, group chat, contacts, send files, Send Emojis, online users, authentication pages, and many more.
It is a real-time chat application using socket.io with MongoDB and MySQL.

We have used a browser navigator for audio and video call.
We didn’t use any third-party packages for audio and video call.
